in js to declare a variable we use let
we cant declare same variable more than once
a variable can hold any type of data in JS

Data type--> type of data/information stored in a variable
we have 2 types 
primitive -->
	 
	number 
	string 
	boolean
	
	undefined
	bigint 

non-primitive
	object
		1. array 
		2. object (JSON object)
		3. Set

		4. Map 
		5. null

NaN---> Not A Number

code optimization
		
1. there must be a common var between 2 statements
2. for that CV there must be = in 1st statement
3. then we can replace CV in Statement2 with RHS from statement 1
4. delete satement1

operation --> perform some tasks example: addition 
operator--> symbol used to perform the operation example:--> +
operand --> input required to perform operation example:  a + b   ==> a & b are called as operands

based on the functionality we have diff types
arithmetic operators
+ - / * % **

operator precedence 

B--> ()
O--> **
DM--> / * %
AS--> + -

BODMAS rules
